Description of Game
This code is a simple game written in Python using the Pygame library. The game involves shooting an apple image and the player gets one point if they hit the apple, and the game ends if they miss. The code initializes a Pygame display and sets a video mode to full screen. It then loads the image files for the apple and orange and creates rect objects for both. The code also creates a font object for displaying the score and messages on the screen. The draw function is used to update the display and display the apple, orange, score, and messages. The place_apple function is used to randomly place the apple and orange on the screen. The welcome_screen function is used to display a welcome message to the player. The end_screen function is used to display a game over message when the player misses the apple. The on_mouse_down function is used to detect when the player clicks the mouse and updates the score and message accordingly. The code then enters a while loop to constantly listen for events and update the display until the player quits the game.
